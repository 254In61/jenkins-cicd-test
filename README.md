Overview
========
=> Directory contains code that's for setting up Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
=> Once pipeline works, this code is left as it is.

Theory
======
=> Test Driven Development : Development and testing is reversed. You write your unit tests first, and then implement
code changes until the tests pass.
